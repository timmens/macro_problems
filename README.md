The solution to the computation exercises in the first problem set can be found in the
notebook ``ps1.ipynb``. You can view it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/timmens/macro_problems/blob/main/ps1.ipynb)
and you can play around with it online (that is, without having to install all the
packages on your local machine) [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/timmens/macro_problems/main?filepath=ps1.ipynb);
note that building the notebook can take a while (up to 5 minutes or so).
